.TH gitinit 1 "December 2024" "1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
gitinit \- Initialize a Git repository with a specific .gitignore file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gitinit
.I <language>

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gitinit
command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory and sets up a `.gitignore` file based on the provided programming language. If the `.gitignore` file is not found locally, it clones the `gitignore` repository from GitHub, retrieves the appropriate file, and sets it up in the working directory.

The command is useful for quickly setting up a Git repository with an appropriate `.gitignore` file for a given programming language.

.SH OPTIONS
.I <language>
The programming language (e.g., "python", "node", "java") for which the corresponding `.gitignore` file will be used.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
To initialize a new Git repository with a `.gitignore` file for Python:

.B gitinit python

.TP
To initialize a new Git repository with a `.gitignore` file for Node.js:

.B gitinit node

.SH USAGE

1. The user should provide the name of the programming language when running the `gitinit` command. For example:
   .B gitinit java
   
2. If the `gitignore` folder does not exist in the user's home directory, the script will clone the official `gitignore` repository from GitHub into `$HOME/gitignore`.

3. Once the repository is cloned (or if it already exists), the script will search for a `.gitignore` file that matches the provided language name. The file will be copied to the current working directory and renamed `.gitignore`.

4. A Git repository will then be initialized in the current directory, if one does not already exist.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The `gitinit` command exits with the following status codes:
.TP
0
The command was successful and the repository was initialized with the appropriate `.gitignore` file.
.TP
1
An error occurred. This could be due to missing arguments, failed cloning of the repository, or other issues (e.g., file not found or git init failure).
