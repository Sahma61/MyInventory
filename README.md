I have gathered **tools**, **scripts**, **custom functions**, **setups** that I use for my coding and personal project developements. I primarily use **Ubuntu(Linux)** for all my coding stuffs, so most of the utilities that I put here are related to **Linux**.

I will try and update stuffs as soon as I create or code new utilities.
